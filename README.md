# ASCII-MADNESS-GAME-

a little game I made for 15-112 at CMU! i hope to make a more polished version with a longer story
and upload it to steam sometime soon :>

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL CMU GRAPHICS TO RUN THE GAME! v easy process, you can find more details [here](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop)
, basically just download CMU graphics from the linked site, unzip the folder and move the resulting folder to the same
directory as your game file(asciimadnessv1.py), then click the game file to run! reach out if you have any difficulty setting it up.

feel free to contact me with any ideas for the final game or questions!
