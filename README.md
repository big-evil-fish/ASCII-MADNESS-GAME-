IMPORTANT NOTE: 
YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL CMU GRAPHICS TO RUN THE GAME! v easy process, you can find more details [here](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop), basically just download CMU graphics from the linked site, unzip the folder and move the 
cmu_graphics folder in cmu_graphics_installer next to your game file(asciimadnessv1.py), then click the game file to run! reach out if you have any difficulty setting it up.
